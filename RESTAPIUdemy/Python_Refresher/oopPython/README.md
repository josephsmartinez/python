# OOP Python

## Class Method

- A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
- They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.
- It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. For example it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.

## Static Method

- A static method is also a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
- A static method canâ€™t access or modify class state.
- It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.

## *args and **kwargs

- `*args` is used to pass an unlimted amount of arguments in the form of a list.
- `**kwargs` like *args but the datastructure is a set `{}`
