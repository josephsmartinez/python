#For the API package, there are two files:

1) api_key.json

Here, you need to enter your NASA API key to access and use APIs available on both NASA API and api.data.gov developer networks.

To get your API key, please visit: https://api.nasa.gov/, then scroll down to 'Get Your API Key' section and enter your first and last names and your FIU email.

Remember, your API key is the first string containing letters and numbers, NOT the url they also provide.

2) COP4814_API.py

This file contains 3 examples of API request in Python: list of names and spacecrafts of the astronauts that are in space now; the 'Astronomy Picture of the Day - APOD'; and the Mars Rover Photos API, which provides access to over 400,000 images gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars.
